        <p>This image is a caricature of me.</p>
        <p>It was done by an artist who was invited to an IT team meeting at work.</p>
        <p>I think IT management were going to use the drawings for something, but they never did.</p>
        <p>I chose it because it captures how other people probably see me.
           Until I saw this drawing I was completely unaware that
           my chin is so pointy.

            Omak is a city located in the foothills of the Okanogan Highlands in north-central Washington, United States. 
            With an estimated 4,845 residents as of 2010, distributed over a land area of 3.43 square miles, 
            Omak is the largest municipality of Okanogan County and the largest municipality in Central Washington north of Wenatchee. 
            The Greater Omak Area of around 8,229 inhabitants as of the 2010 census is the largest urban cluster in the Okanogan Country 
            region, encompassing most of its twin city of Okanogan. The population has increased significantly since the 1910 census, 
            reporting 520 residents just prior to incorporation in 1911.
          </p>
          <p>
            The land that is now Omak had been inhabited by various Native American tribes before the arrival of non-indigenous settlers 
            in the early 19th century. The city began to develop after the completion of the Okanogan Irrigation Project affecting the 
            Grand Coulee Dam and other nearby electric facilities. The housing and municipal infrastructure, along with regional 
            infrastructure connecting the new town to other municipalities, were built simultaneously in 1908 supported by the local 
            agricultural industry. The name Omak comes from the Okanagan placename or the Salishan term Omache—which is 
            said to mean &quot;good medicine&quot; or &quot;plenty&quot;, referring to its favorable climate, with an annual high of around 88 deg F. 
            Omak acts as the gateway to the Okanogan National Forest and consists of a central business district and residential 
            neighborhoods.
          </p>
          <p>
             Omak is a code city governed by a seven-member council and the state&apos;s 4th district. Omak&apos;s economy is dominated by the 
             primary industries of agriculture and forestry, although economic diversification has occurred with sawmills and 
             recreational tourism. Nearby recreational destinations include walking trails, state parks and national forests, such as 
             Conconully State Park, Bridgeport State Park and Osoyoos Lake State Park. The city is home to a weekly newspaper, the 
             Omak–Okanogan County Chronicle, and a Wenatchee Valley College campus. Standards for education in Omak are higher than the 
             state&apos;s average, though drugs and alcohol remain a problem among students. U.S. Route 97 passes through the town, while 
             Washington State Route 155, as well as Washington State Route 215, connects the city to Okanogan and Nespelem, respectively. 
             By road, Omak is located approximately 235 miles from Seattle, Washington, 140 miles from Spokane, 
             Washington and 125 miles from Kelowna, British Columbia.

        <h2>Health</h2>
        <p class="health_p1">Before committing to a lifetime with a Havanese, it is important to understand that the breed can experience
            a variety of serious health issues.  It is worthwhile to look into purchasing 
            <a href = "https://www.embracepetinsurance.com/dog-breeds/havanese" title="Health Insurance For Havanese" target="_blank"> 
            health insurance</a> if you own a Havanese. The following is a list of the health issues that our
            Havanese, Indiana Jones, is already experiencing at age 4.  <a href = "https://www.havanese.org/health/layman-s-guide-to-havanese-health" 
            title="A Layman Guide To Havanese Health" target="_blank">A Layman Guide To Havanese Health</a> offers a more complete listing
            of recommended health testing and possible health issues for the breed.

                    <h3>Allergies</h3>
                    <p>The most common health problem in the Havanese is chronic allergies which can cause itchy skin 
                       possibly leading to skin infections.  Additionally, Indiana Jones is allergic to a variety of food
                       and requires special dog food which IS. NOT. CHEAP. </p>
                    <h3>OFA Patella Luxation</h3>
                    <p>Patellar luxation occurs when the dog's kneecap (patella) is temporarily dislocated from its normal position.
                       It is a hereditary condition typical in a number of small dog breeds.  This is noticeable in Indiana Jones in 
                       that he will hold his back leg up and &quot;skip&quot; for periods of time when 
                       walking. </p>
                    <h3>Ear Infections</h3>
                    <p>Allergies combined with the profuse growth of hair in the ear make ear infections more likely for Havanese
                       than other dogs.</p>
